## Description

This project aims to bring complete ray tracing support for Minecraft's default resources in a manner that seamlessly integerates with the vanilla game while maintaining a native look and feel.

- **[Vanilla RTX:](https://mcpedl.com/vanilla-rtx)** Uses 16x heightmaps with 192x normal maps generated based on height differences.  
- **[Vanilla RTX Normals:](https://mcpedl.com/vanilla-rtx-normals)** Features handcrafted 16x normal maps instead.
- **Vanilla RTX Opus:** The composition of both Vanilla RTX & Vanilla RTX Normals. (Coming Very Soon!)
- Every possible vanilla block is supported (Creative, Education Edition, secret or unobtainable blocks, etc...)
- All blocks feature highly detailed, unique material designs that remain consistent across different blocks made of similar materials.
- Compatibility errors of vanilla resources with ray tracing are resolved through the Enhanced option as much as possible. (accessed from resource pack's settings)
- The packs are regularly updated for full coverage of the latest Minecraft updates.  
- Related Projects:
  - **[Vanilla RTX App (Recommended):](https://github.com/Cubeir/Vanilla-RTX-app)** A companion app that lets you access Minecraft with RTX easily, adjust fog, lighting & materials in any RTX resource pack, with automated package updates and more... 
  - **[Vanilla RTX Add-Ons:](https://mcpedl.com/vanilla-rtx-add-ons)** A series of smaller packs that can be modularly applied over Vanilla RTX to give certain blocks interesting non-vanilla properties for ray tracing.
  - **[Chemistry RTX Extensions:](https://mcpedl.com/chemistry-rtx/)** Additional world-only resource packs to add ray tracing support to the content available under Minecraft: Education Edition toggle.
  - **[Vanilla Vibrant Visuals:](https://mcpedl.com/vanilla-pbr)** A branch of Vanilla RTX for Vibrant Visuals graphics mode usable on a wider range of hardware.

Initial goal of this project was to create a fresh Bedrock Edition equivalent of [Vanilla Normals Renewed](https://github.com/Poudingue/Vanilla-Normals-Renewed). This effort later evolved into Vanilla RTX Normals. Vanilla RTX now strives to provide an ideal default ray-traced Minecraft experience for all Bedrock Edition players.

## Usage Tips
- For Installation: Each folder in this repository is a complete package. To import one, download and extract the whole repo, compress either one of the folders `Vanilla-RTX` or `Vanilla-RTX-Normals` into a `.zip` file, rename the `.zip` extension to `.mcpack`, then open it with Minecraft to import while the game is closed.  
[Vanilla RTX App](https://github.com/Cubeir/Vanilla-RTX-app) automates this process, so you can easily keep the pack updated for the latest version of the game.

- Activation issues: There is a problem that will keep Vanilla RTX from loading. To prevent this, ray tracing must be enabled before joining a world. However since Minecraft 1.21.60, ray tracing can only be initially toggled while inside a world.  
Workaround: While in the main menu, head to video settings, turn on `Allow In-Game Graphics Mode Switching` then join any world, enable ray tracing from the dropdown graphics mode menu in video settings (you may experience issues at first), now exit to the main menu and rejoin. Once ray tracing is enabled, do not turn it off to prevent this issue from occurring again.
The [Vanilla RTX App](https://github.com/Cubeir/Vanilla-RTX-app) simplifies this by launching the game with ray tracing pre-enabled. (Recommended while [MCPE-191513](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE/issues/MCPE-191513) and [MCPE-121850](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE/issues/MCPE-121850) persist).

- If you're experiencing performance issues, [disable Minecraft's VSync](https://youtu.be/CKK1VSbGGnk), you can keep VSync on in your graphics card's control panel. This also reduces input latency when compared to Minecraft's VSync. (VSync is automatically disabled by the Vanilla RTX App while [MCPE-121850](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE/issues/MCPE-121850) persists)

- If you've encountered visual glitches, be informed that they are most likely issues tied to the game, everything was already done in this pack to solve as many of them as possible, for an up-to-date list of fixes [visit this page](https://minecraftrtx.net/enhancements).  
However there are limits to resource packs, and most of the remainig issues you encounter can only be solved by Mojang. They're likely already reported at [bugs.mojang.com](https://bugs.mojang.com/), consider voting for them.

- Always ensure that world, server or realm resource packs aren't overriding Vanilla RTX to avoid issues.

Reminder:  
Vanilla RTX and its derivative works are completely free to download and use, any project that uses them is also required to remain free.  
However be aware there are many non-attributed copies of Vanilla RTX that circulate, often under entirely different names and even for sale. These copies may, at best, replicate the version available on this page.

Disclaimers:  
Not associated or affiliated with Mojang Studios or Nvidia.  

The license file linked above does not apply to any original Minecraft art resource.  

Please note that this pack relies on some of Minecraft's original art resources (found at [this github repository](https://aka.ms/resourcepacktemplate)) to function.
This is due to a game limitation where texture maps can only be called within the pack and once removed, the game stops defaulting to its own resources, contrary to the usual behavior of Minecraft texture packs. Consequently, Vanilla RTX unavoidably has to include a small part of base game's resources as referenced by ```texture_set.json``` files. As time passes this may result in outdated resources. Parity checks are performed on a regular basis with the pack adjusted accordingly.  
It is also worth noting large parts of vanilla resources also had to be modified for compatibility with ray tracing or to work around other technical issues or limitations, without altering their in-game appearance. For instance, the Enhanced option which addresses a wide range of compatibility issues with Minecraft’s vanilla resources in ray tracing graphics mode, [learn more](https://minecraftrtx.net/enhancements).
